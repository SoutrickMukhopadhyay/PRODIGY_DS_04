# PRODIGY DATA SCIENCE TASK-04

Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

# SOCIAL MEDIA SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By leveraging the power of natural language processing and data visualization, we aim to provide a clear understanding of sentiment trends within the data.

# INTRODUCTION

Social media platforms have become a significant source of public sentiment data. Analyzing this data can be valuable for businesses, researchers, and decision-makers to understand how people feel about their products, services, or specific topics. This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis and visualize the results.

# PRE-REQUISITIES

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Python (>=3.6) installed on your system.
Required Python libraries (you can install them using pip):
pandas
matplotlib
textblob pip install pandas matplotlib textblob

# USAGE

Modify the analyze_sentiment and categorize_sentiment functions in sentiment_analysis.py if needed, to customize the sentiment analysis logic.
Adjust the visualization settings, such as colors, labels, and plot sizes, in the script to suit your preferences.

# RESULTS

The project generates two main types of visualizations:

Average Sentiment by Category Bar Chart: This chart displays the average sentiment polarity for each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, and Neutral). It provides a quick overview of the sentiment distribution within the data.

Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart: This chart shows the distribution of sentiments as a percentage of the total data. It offers insights into the overall sentiment balance.

These visualizations can help you better understand public sentiment towards specific topics or brands.
